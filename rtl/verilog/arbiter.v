// Two synchronous arbiter implementations are provided:
// 'arbiter' and 'arbiter_x2'. Both are round-robin arbiters
// with a configurable number of inputs. The algorithm used is
// recursive in that you can build a larger arbiter from a
// tree of smaller arbiters. 'arbiter_x2' is a tree of
// 'arbiter' modules, 'arbiter' is a tree of 'arbiter_node'
// modules, and 'arbiter_node' is the primitive of the
// algorithm, a two input round-robin arbiter.
//
// Both 'arbiter' and 'arbiter_x2' can take multiple clocks
// to grant a request. (Of course, neither arbiter should
// assert an invalid grant while changing state.) 'arbiter'
// can take up to three clocks to grant a req, and 'arbiter_x2'
// can take up to five clocks. 'arbiter_x2' is probably only
// necessary for configurations over a thousand inputs.
// Presently, the width of both 'arbiter' and 'arbiter_x2'
// must be power of two due to the way they instantiate a tree
// of sub-arbiters. Extra inputs can be assigned to zero, and
// extra outputs can be left disconnected.
//
// Parameters for 'arbiter' and 'arbiter_x2':
//   'width' is width of the 'req' and 'grant' ports, which
//     must be a power of two.
//   'select_width' is the width of the 'select' port, which
//     should be the log base two of 'width'.
//
// Ports for 'arbiter' and 'arbiter_x2':
//   'enable' masks the 'grant' outputs. It is used to chain
//     arbiters together, but it might be useful otherwise.
//     It can be left disconnected if not needed.
//   'req' are the input lines asserted to request access to
//     the arbitrated resource.
//   'grant' are the output lines asserted to grant each
//     requestor access to the arbitrated resource.
//   'select' is a binary encoding of the bitwise 'grant'
//     output. It is useful to control a mux that connects
//     requestor outputs to the arbitrated resource. It can
//     be left disconnected if not needed.
//   'valid' is asserted when any 'req' is asserted. It is
//     used to chain arbiters together, but it might be
//     otherwise useful. It can be left disconnected if not
//     needed.

// 'arbiter_x2' is a two-level tree of arbiters made from
// registered 'arbiter' modules. It allows a faster clock in
// large configurations by breaking the arbiter into two
// registered stages. For most uses, the standard 'arbiter'
// module is plenty fast. See the 'demo_arbiter' module for
// some implemntation results.
